## Key Features

BakeryTrack offers a suite of tools tailored for bakery management:

- **üçû Ingredient Management:**

  - Track detailed information for each ingredient (name, description, category, unit, cost).
  - Manage supplier information and link ingredients to suppliers.
  - Set minimum and ideal stock levels for automated alerts and optimized ordering.
  - View current stock levels calculated from non-expired batches.
  - Mark ingredients as active or inactive.

- **üì¶ Batch Tracking (FIFO & Expiry):**

  - Record incoming ingredient batches with quantity, purchase date, and expiry date.
  - Automatically calculates remaining quantity based on usage.
  - Supports First-In, First-Out (FIFO) logic for usage recommendations (implicitly through expiry date sorting).
  - Dashboard highlights batches nearing expiry.
  - View detailed usage history for each batch.

- **üç∞ Recipe Management:**

  - Create and manage detailed recipes, including ingredients, quantities, preparation steps, baking time, and yield.
  - Define selling prices for finished products.
  - Easily view ingredients required for any recipe.

- **üìà Sales Tracking & Analytics:**

  - Record sales transactions, linking sold items to specific recipes.
  - Track sales date, time, day of the week, quantities, and total amount.
  - Provides historical sales data crucial for forecasting.

- **üß† Demand Forecasting (TensorFlow.js Model):**

  - Predict future demand for specific recipes based on historical sales data.
  - Utilizes a simple **Dense Neural Network** model implemented with **TensorFlow.js** for time-series prediction, trained on past sales patterns.
  - Generates forecasts for a defined period (e.g., the next 7 days).
  - Visualizes predicted vs. actual sales data using charts.
  - Allows saving generated forecasts for future reference.

- **üìä Ingredient Requirements Calculation:**

  - Automatically calculates the total quantity of each ingredient needed based on the demand forecast for a specific recipe.
  - Compares required amounts with current stock levels to identify potential shortages.
  - Visualizes requirements vs. stock using charts.

- **üìâ Yield Management & Waste Tracking:**

  - Record ingredient usage during production, specifying reasons like production, spoilage, or waste.
  - Updates ingredient batch quantities automatically.
  - Helps identify areas of high wastage.

- **üîí User Authentication:**

  - Secure user sign-up, sign-in, and password management powered by **Supabase Auth**.
  - Handles email confirmation and password resets.

- **üìú Activity Logging:**

  - Records key user actions (e.g., adding ingredients, creating sales, updating batches) for audit trails.

- **üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Overview:**
  - Provides a quick summary of recent activities and ingredients nearing expiry.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL Database
- Supabase Account (for authentication and potentially database hosting)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tangweilun/bakery_ims.git
    cd bakery-web-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

    **Note:** Ensure you run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to download all necessary project dependencies before proceeding.

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # Database URLs (Prisma)
    # Use connection pooling for serverless environments if applicable
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    # Direct URL is needed for migrations/introspection
    DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"

    # Supabase Credentials
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

    # Optional: Supabase Service Role Key (if needed for server-side admin tasks, keep secure)
    # SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Apply Prisma Migrations:**
    This command will synchronize your database schema with the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    _(You might need a different migration name if `init` already exists)_

2.  **(Optional) Seed the database:**
    If you want to populate the database with initial sample data (suppliers, ingredients, recipes):
    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```
    _(Requires the `prisma/seed.ts` file and `ts-node` to be configured in `package.json`)_

### Running the Application

1.  **For Development:**
    Start the development server with hot-reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **For Production:**
    Build the application for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    Then, start the production server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured for production).
